# What is this?
This project is meant to make a simple userspace init system, kinda like a "start on login" feature that most desktops have,
but better as it will allow you to RESTART one of those automated startup programs should it cause issues

# Use Cases?
use cases can be termux on your phone
serverside that needs to run services when a user logs in, 
General desktop usage where there are some background processes that may need to be restarted, and you just wanna save time
